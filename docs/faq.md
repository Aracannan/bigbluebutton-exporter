## Scalelite Support
BigBlueButton Exporter can be used alongside Scalelite.
In fact the exporter doesn't need to know anything about Scalelite (or 
Scalelite about the exporter) since the exporter still needs to be configured
to scrape metrics from the BigBlueButton server's API.
See [comment in Issue #31](https://github.com/greenstatic/bigbluebutton-exporter/issues/31#issuecomment-632335583).
